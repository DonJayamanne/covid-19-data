<h1>New cases per day</h1><br/>
This trend line is a moving average of new cases over time. First for the US overall then by state (not all are represented here, just ones I found most interesting.

<h1>State and County cases adjusted for population</h1><br/>
To better get a sense of how different states may be handling the virus outbreak, you can
adjust the graphs to account for the number of people who live in each state. A state that has
100,000 people vs 8,000,000 people will obviously look far better with regard to total cases
because they have 80x less people. By factoring in the population of a state, this is difference
is accounted for.

<br/><br/><div>
<h1>State cases adjusted for population density</h1><br/>
Each state and county obviously has a population and an area in which this population lives. *Pretend* for a moment that Texas only has 100,000
people total. Also *pretend* that Rhode Island has 100,000 people. However, you also know that the
land area of Rhode Island is much, much smaller than that of Texas. So, if Rhode Island gets 5,000 cases of the virus
and Texas also gets 5,000 case, then you can say with high confidence that the people in Texas are likely completely
ignoring advice to keep a minimum distance from others. I mean how else could they have the same number of cases as Rhode Island
where the same number of people are packed together?<br/>
<br/>
This graph removes this consideration from the comparison between states. As you can see, New Jersey is doing far worse than
than Ohio, Washington and California.

<h1>City total cases adjusted for population</h1><br/>
To better get a sense of how different cities may be handling the virus outbreak, you can
adjust the graphs to account for the number of people who live in each city. A city that has
100,000 people vs 8,000,000 people will obviously look far better with regard to total cases
because they have 80x less people. By factoring in the population of a city, this is difference
is accounted for.

<h1>City total cases adjusted for population density</h1><br/>
Same trends as described for state cases adjusted for population density, but applied at the city level instead. The intent of
this graph is to discount the consideration that some cities growth rates are so fast because those cities are so densely populated.
This was a common explanation as to why New York was growing so much faster than other cities. Though even when taking density into account,
New York's trend <b>still</b> beats all others.

<h1>City <b>deaths</b> adjusted for population density</h1><br/>
See description above concerning cases adjusted for population density. This is the same, but is about deaths, not just cases.
